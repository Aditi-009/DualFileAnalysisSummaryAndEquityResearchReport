Project Setup Guide

1. Clone the project from GitHub
Download or clone all project files from your GitHub repository to your local system.

2. Open the project in VS Code
Launch Visual Studio Code and open the project folder containing 'frontend.py' and 'backend.py'.

3. Set up the environment variables
Create a new file named '.env' in the root of your project. Copy and paste the .env contents you
received (e.g., from WhatsApp) into this file. Ensure it includes your 'OPENAI_API_KEY'.

4. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code
From the top menu bar, select: Terminal.

5. Create and activate a virtual environment
Run the following commands one by one: 
a. python -m venv venv (create virtual environment) 
b. source venv/bin/activate (activate it on macOS/Linux).

6. Install all required dependencies
Use this command to install all packages listed in 'requirements.txt':   
pip install -r requirements.txt

7. Run the Streamlit app
Once installation is complete, start the application with: 
streamlit run frontend.py
